The mnemonics assigned to the instructions are designed to indicate the function of the instruction. The Instructions fall into the following functional categories:

Data Transfer Group. The data transfer instructions move data between registers or between memory and registers.
MOV     Move Immediate
MVI     Move Immediate
LDA     Load Accumulator Directly from Memory
STA     Store Accumulator Directly in Memory
LHLD    Load Hand L Registers Directly from Memory
SHLD    Store Hand L Registers Directly in Memory

An 'X' In the name of a data transfer instruction implies that it deals with a register pair:
LXI     Load Register Pair with Immediate data
LDAX    Load Accumulator from Address in Register Pair
STAX    Store Accumulator in Address in Register Pair
XCHG    Exchange H and L with D and E
XTHL    Exchange Top of Stack with H and L

Arithmetic Group. The arithmetic instructions add, subtract, increment, or decrement data in registers or memory.
ADD     Add to Accumulator
ADI     Add Immediate Data to Accumulator
ADC     Add to Accumulator Using Carry Flag
ACI     Add Immediate Data to Accumulator Using Carry Flag
SUB     Subtract from Accumulator
SUI     Subtract Immediate Data from Accumulator
SBB     Subtract from Accumulator Using Borrow (Carry) Flag
SBI     Subtract Immediate from Accumulator Using Borrow
INR     Increment Specified Byte by One
DCR     Decrement Specified Byte by One
INX     Increment Register Pair by One
DCX     Decrement Register Pair by One
DAD     Double Register Add: Add Contents of Register Pair to Hand L Register Pair

Logical Group. This group performs logical (Boolean) operations on data in registers and memory and on condition flags.
The logical, AND, OR, and Exclusive OR instructions enable you to set specific bits in the accumulator ON or OFF.
ANA     Logical AND with Accumulator
ANI     Logical AND with Accumulator Using Immediate Data
ORA     Logical OR with Accumulator
ORI     Logical OR with Accumulator Using Immediate Data
XRA     Exclusive Logical OR with Accumulator
XRI     Exclusive OR Using Immediate Data

The compare instructions compare the contents of an 8Â·blt value with the contents of the accumulator:
CMP     Compare
CPI     Compare Using Immediate Data

The rotate instructions shift the contents of the accumulator one bit position to the left or right:
RLC     Rotate Accumulator Left
RRC     Rotate Accumulator Right
RAL     Rotate Left Through Carry
RAR     Rotate Right Through Carry

Complement ald carry flag instructions:
CMA     Complement Accumulator
CMC     Complement Carry Flag
STC     Set Carry Flag

Branch Group. The branching instructions alter normal sequential program flow. either unconditionally or
conditionallY. fhe unconditional branching instructions are as follows:
JMP     Jump
CALL    Call
RET     Return

Conditional bnnching Instructions examine the status of one of four condition flags to determine whether the
specified brant h IS to be executed. The conditions that may be specified are as follows:
NZ      NotZero(Z=0)
Z       Zero(Z=1)
NC      NoCarry(C=0)
C       Carry (C = 1)
PO      Parity Odd (P =0)
PE      Parity Even (P = 1)
P       Plus (5 = 0)
M       Minus (5 1)

Jumps   Calls   Returns
JC      CC      RC      (Carry)
JNC     CNC     RNC     (No Carry)
JZ      CZ      RZ      (Zero)
JNZ     CNZ     RNZ     (Not Zero)
JP      CP      RP      (Plus)
JM      CM      RM      (Minus)
JPE     CPE     RPE     (Parity Even)
JPO     CPO     RPO     (Parity Odd)


Two other instructions can effect a branch by replacing the contents of the program counter:
PCHL    Move Hand L to Program Counter
RST     Special Restart Instruction Used with Interrupts 

Stack, //0, and Machine Contra/Instructions. The following instructions affect the stack and/or stack pOinter'
PUSH    Push Two Bytes of Data onto the Stack
POP     Pop Two Bytes of Data off the Stack
XTHL    Exchange Top of Stack with Hand L
SPHL    Move contents of Hand L to Stack Pointer

The I/O instructions are as follows:
IN      Initiate Input Operation
OUT     Initiate Output Operation

The machine control Instructions are as follows:
EI      Enable Interrupt System
DI      Disable Interrupt System
HLT     Halt
NOP     No Operation
